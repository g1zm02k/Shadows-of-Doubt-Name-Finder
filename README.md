# Shadows-of-Doubt-Name-Finder
Small script/app to decode those pesky name anagrams left at the crime scene.

If you have AHK v2 installed you can download the script and run it as-is; if not, you can download the executable and run that instead - in either case you'll need the list of names in the same directory.

Just run the script/app and type in all the letters found on the sheet of paper; order doesn't matter - just include all the letters!
