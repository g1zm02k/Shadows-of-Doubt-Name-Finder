# Shadows-of-Doubt-Name-Finder
Small script/app to decode those pesky name anagrams left at the crime scene.

If you have AHK v2 installed you can download the script and the 'SoD Surnames.txt' file and run it as-is; if not, you can download the executable and run that instead (the name list is embedded).

Just run the script/app and type in all the letters found on the sheet of paper; order doesn't matter - just include all the letters!
